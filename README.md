HackMiT 2020.

Have a question, but donâ€™t want to sift through a whole lecture video to find your answer? Ask A Lecture has your back! Through our website, students can select a lecture as uploaded by instructors, and enter any question they may have; our project then uses machine learning and natural language processing on the audio transcript to find the relevant section and take you right to the timestamp in the lecture video that answers your question, creating a powerful tool for students to take advantage of the wealth of information provided by online learning.
 
COVID-19 has pushed educational institutions all across the world towards online learning. While this has posed many challenges, online instructions, especially through Zoom, have provided a wealth of information that is readily available for students. However, there is no solution that can efficiently analyze the information. Our project uses machine learning and natural language processing to match student questions to corresponding timestamps in lectures, creating a powerful tool for students to take advantage of stored information.
